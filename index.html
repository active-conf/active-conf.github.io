										<h2>Active'17</h2>
										<p>First International Workshop on Data Management on
										Virtualized Active Systems.</p>
									</header>
									<p>

										<h3>Objective</h3>
										The objective of this one-day workshop is to bring researchers and practitioners
										together in order to investigate opportunities in exploiting virtualized active
										(compute-enabled) technologies such as active memory, active network, and active
										storage for accelerating data-intensive workloads. Furthermore, this workshop aims
										at investigating issues in realizing active capabilities (enabled by hardware
										accelerators such as SSDs, GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs) in the entire system stack
										running on cloud. The workshop aims at providing a forum for academia and industry
										to exchange ideas through research and position papers.

										<br>
										<br>

										<h3>Scope</h3>
										The recent popularity of Big Data applications has renewed interest in developing
										and optimizing data-intensive workloads. In addition to the traditional
										scientific computing domain, Big Data phenomena are observed in a variety
										of new domains such as Internet of Things (IoT), social analytic, personalized
										health and precision medicine, bioinformatics, energy informatics, and
										emergency response and disaster management.  The Big Data workloads
										are characterized by unprecedented volumes and velocity of data, both historic
										and transient, very high-speed data flows (e.g., from sensor networks), and
										diverse variety of data from completely unstructured text documents, to
										structured relational tables or matrices, to photos and videos. Analyzing vast
										quantities of such complex data (partially powered by machine learning) is
										becoming as important as the traditional massive-scale data management.

										<br>
										<br>

										Unfortunately, existing approaches to solve data-intensive problems are
										woefully inadequate to address the challenges raised by the Big Data
										applications. Specifically, these approaches require data to be processed to
										be moved near the computing resources. These data movement costs can be
										prohibitive for large data sets such as those observed in the aforementioned
										workloads. One way to address this problem is to bring virtualized computing
										resources closer to data, whether it is at rest or in motion. The premise of
										"active" systems is a new holistic view of the system in which every data
										medium (whether volatile or non-volatile) and every communication channel
										becomes compute-enabled.

										<br>
										<br>

										Although prototypes of systems with active technologies are currently
										available, there is a very limited exploitation of their capabilities
										in real-life problems.  The proposed workshop aims to evaluate different
										aspects of the active systems stack and understand the impact of active
										technologies (including but not limited to hardware accelerators such
										as SSDs, GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs) on different applications workloads.
										Specifically, the workshop aims to understand the role of modern hardware
										to enable active medium (whether network, storage, or memory) over the entire
										path and the lifecycle of data, especially as today's database system opt for
										hierarchies of storage and memory. Furthermore, we aim to revisit the
										interplay between algorithmic modeling, compiler and programming languages,
										virtualized runtime systems and environments, and hardware implementations,
										for effective exploitation of active technologies.
